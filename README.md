# Video Object Blur

Automated web application for selectively blurring objects within uploaded videos based on user-defined parameters.

## Overview

Video Object Blur is a web application designed to provide users with an intuitive platform to upload videos and selectively blur specific objects within those videos. This project offers a solution for privacy concerns or content editing where certain objects need to be obscured. Users can define the objects they want to blur, set the time range for the blurring effect, and adjust the blur intensity according to their preferences.

## Features

- **Upload Video:** Users can easily upload videos directly through the web interface.
- **Selective Object Blur:** Users have the ability to select specific objects within the video that they want to blur.
- **Time Range Selection:** Users can define the time range during which the selected objects will be blurred.
- **Adjustable Blur Intensity:** The intensity of the blur effect can be adjusted to suit the user's requirements.
- **Automatic Blurring:** Once the parameters are set, the application automatically applies the blur effect to the specified objects within the defined time range.
